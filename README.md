# Web Development Project 5 - Weather & Location Dashboard

Submitted by:  Roel Crodua

This web app: 
This project is a Weather and Location Dashboard that shows key weather details using data from a public API. It gives users an easy view of current conditions, allows searching by location, and displays results that can be filtered. The app uses React features like useEffect, map(), and filter() to fetch and show live data, respond to user input, and make weather information simple and engaging to explore.

Time spent: 20 hours spent in total
